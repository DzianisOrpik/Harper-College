Module 5


Accessibility Testing Tools
The first step towards an accessible web page is to follow W3C standards:

Use the W3C Validator at http://validator.w3.org/ to check for HTML syntax errors.
Use the W3C Validator at http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ to check for CSS syntax errors. 

The next step ...

While automated accessibility testing tools can be useful in pointing out potential issues, there is a huge human element when testing for accessibility. For example, just because an image has alt text, doesn't mean the alt text description is actually useful to a human being -- that takes a human to judge. We'll get into more involved accessibility evaluation later on (in Module 11). However, now is a good time to get familiar with the tools below.

Test one of your favorite web sites in each of these online accessibility testing tools:

Module 11



Readings
The following articles are informational and should provide you with a general overview of accessibility issues related to ARIA -- focus on the function of the role attribute as you read the resources below. We will not be doing any scripting in this WEB 210 course.

Overview of Aria  
https://uxplanet.org/improve-the-accessibility-of-your-designs-with-aria-4595d8ea060f
Rich Internet Application  Accessibility 
https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#intro_ria_accessibility



ARIA Landmark Roles
application ( an area of a web page that functions as a web application instead of providing static content)
banner (an area of a web page that contains mostly site-oriented content  -- like a logo -- rather than page-specific content)
complementary (a supporting part of the web page document, designed to be complementary to the main content )
contentinfo (an area that contains information such as copyright and/or hyperlinks to privacy statements). 
form (an area of a web page that function together as a form)
main (the main content of a document)
navigation (a collection of navigation elements)
search (an area of a web page that provides search functionality)

Module 12



Strategies for Accessibility Testing
Evaluating Web Sites for Accessibility (Overview)
http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/preliminary.html

Note: Before testing web pages for accessibility, also verify that they comply with web standards: HTML Validation (http://validator.w3.org/) and CSS Validation (http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).


No single tool can test all Web standards automatically. 
Verification requires use of automated testing tools, assistive technology and manual checks.

Use one of the checklists below as a "road map" â€” complete each indicated test. 

WebAim WCAG 2.0 Checklist
http://www.webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist

IITAA Testing Checklist
http://www.dhs.state.il.us/accessibility/references/iitaa-testing-checklist.html

IITAA condensed checklist (this one is a bit more readable)
http://www.dhs.state.il.us/IITAA/IITAAWebImplementationGuidelines.html
Run an automated checking tool (see the Automated Accessibility Testing Tools in Module 5 and fix any additional errors identified in reports.

Listen with assistive technology such as JAWS or Window-Eyes to ensure the site is accessible and usable.

Check login pages, templates, navigation.
Check pages with data tables, forms and multimedia.
Verify keyboard access
Tab to links and controls (e.g. form input fields)
JavaScript keyboard access

Optional: Test with a text-only browser (or browser with images off)

Optional: Test with a color-blindness simulation

Optional: Test for appropriate reading level

Complete additional manual checks as needed for some standards/checkpoints

Color
